Note that the follows table has an unusual arrangement: it has two foreign keys to the same table. Why?
It's got 2 foreign keys because the pair of them represent the primary key. It links one user to another user.

How is the logged in user being kept track of?
Before every request, it checks to see if the session has a user, if it does, then it will get the user from the db to use  

What is Flaskâ€™s g object?
It is global namespace to hold data for one single request. It is accessible by the route and other functions during this request
so we won't need to pass around this information.

What is the purpose of add_user_to_g?
It makes the current user available for access during the request. 

What does @app.before_request mean?
It means the function will run before every request.

*******************
my questions
For the test files, why do we always need to delete like this:
        User.query.delete()
        Message.query.delete()
        Follows.query.delete()

        How do we get the id data if we don't hardcode it?

test_user_edit_profile_success, don't know how to pass in form data: right now,
password is not working.

test_user_login, how to get the session data?
